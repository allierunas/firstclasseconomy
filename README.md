# First Class Economy

Flying economy doesn't have to feel like anything but first class.

## Inspiration
Southwest's model of open seating sometimes means facing the unknown. Is that seat really open? Will I get a window seat? Seeing exactly which seats are open live allows passengers to know what area of the plane to head to when boarding. 

## Features
Hardware sensors detect which seats are open and update a live view of seats for passengers to know which seats they want to go towards. 

## How we built it
* HTML/CSS/JS 
* Arduino and Hardware prototyping
* Adroid Studio
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Front-end library
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Javascript library

## Challenges we ran into
We had a tricky time getting our API to integrate with our front end solutions. Help from our mentors got us back on the right track.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
* Polling API with live updates to seat occupancy
* Clean and simple interface
* Mobile web and Android solutions

## What we learned
* Hardware/software integration for IOT development
* Web development
* Android development

## What's next for First Class Economy
* sleep
